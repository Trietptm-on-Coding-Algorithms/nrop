# Documentation

The nrop components and tricks are detailed in the following sections.

# Disassemblers

nrop relied for a long time on the XED disassemblers, but now a new tiny interface is available to use your custom state-of-art disassembler. You can see the in-depth details in the [dedicated documentation page][2].

# FAQ

The compilation can be complicated, and the [faq dedicated page][1] is a convenient start to progress.
